The maximum number of Powerpuff Girls which can be created are 3 as after 3, Professor will run out of Ingredient C.

Can you determine the maximum number?


Input Format
============
The first line of input consists of the number of ingredients, N

The second line of input consists of the N space-separated integers representing the quantity of each ingredient required to create a Powerpuff Girl.

The third line of input consists of the N space-separated integers representing the quantity of each ingredient present in the laboratory.


Constraints
============
1<= N <=10000000 (1e7)
